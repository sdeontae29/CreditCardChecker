# CreditCardChecker
This project was code a created for a class assignment. 
It uses Hans Peter Luhn of IBM, algorithm used in the process of validating a credit(or debit) card.
In short, the numbers you see on the back of your credit card are not all random.
American Express uses 15 digit numbers. All AmEx numbers start with 34 or 37.
Mastercard uses 16 digits. Mastercard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55. There are other numbers that MasterCard uses but for this lab, we are limiting to just these 5.
Visa uses 13 - 16 digit numbers. All visa numbers start with 4.
This is how when you input your card number, some websites can quickly detect the type of card and if it is valid or not
The code created only focues on these three card types.
